This lab involves using objdump and gdb to step through a
compiled program which takes in 5 strings. Each string
corresponds to a funciton in the program. Each function 
requires a particular string in order to return the correct
value so that the program continues to run. It requires the
recognition of recursive functions and various data structures
in x86-assembly language.
